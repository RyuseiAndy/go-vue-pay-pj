## Why did you decide to create it? ##
<p>
<h3><span class="mgr-10">ー   I want to create a simple payment service using gRPC.After considering the advantages, I thought it would be useful for improving my skills in the future. This was the first time for me to actually write a database and front-end process, but I proceeded with the work with the help of my friend who works as a web engineer.   </span></h3>

## Benefits ##

<h3>ー   Easy to define API design and specification, rules are defined and difficult to deviate from   </h3>
<h3>ー   Benefit from HTTP/2 (high speed, two-way streaming communication)   </h3>
